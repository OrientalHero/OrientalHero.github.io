<p class="notes">Avatar (marketed as James Cameron's Avatar) is a 2009 American[7][8] epic science fiction
        film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and starring Sam Worthington,
        Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set in the mid-22nd
        century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri
        star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium,[9][10] a room-temperature superconductor.[11] The expansion
        of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi – a humanoid species indigenous to
        Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely loca
        ted human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[12]</p>

<p class="text4">
    The Lord of the Rings (also promoted as The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy) is
    a film series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They
    are based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are subtitled The Fel
    lowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). They were d
    istributed by New Line Cinema.

Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken, with an overall bu
    dget of $281 million (some sources say $310-$330 million),[3] the entire project took eight years, w
    ith the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand, Jackson's native
    country.[4] Each film in the series also had special extended editions released on DVD a year after
    their respective theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit
    some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.
